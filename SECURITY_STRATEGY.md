# Security Strategy â€“ Splace E-commerce Platform (Phase 3)

## Overview

This document outlines the cybersecurity strategy for Phase 3 of the Splace e-commerce platform project, focusing on securing 
the development environment, defining secure architecture, and integrating security best practices across all system components.

---

## Objectives

- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all components.
- Minimize attack surfaces through secure coding and architecture.
- Implement access control, encryption, and monitoring mechanisms.
- Ensure secure integration with third-party services and APIs.

---

## Key Areas of Focus

### 1. Development Environment Hardening
- Use of secured and isolated development environments (e.g., VMs, containers).
- Enforce role-based access to repositories and build pipelines.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all team members.

### 2. Secure Architecture Principles
- Apply Zero Trust principles.
- Microservices (or monolith) architecture reviewed for vulnerabilities.
- Limit open ports and exposed services via firewalls and reverse proxies.

### 3. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Define user roles and permissions for system modules.
- Implement OAuth2.0 / JWT for authentication.
- Store credentials securely using environment variables or secret managers.

### 4. Data Protection
- Use TLS 1.2+ for all communications.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (AES-256 recommended).
- Implement data masking for logs and non-production environments.

### 5. API Security
- Input validation and rate limiting.
- API gateway with authentication and IP whitelisting.
- Regular testing using tools like OWASP ZAP or Postman security tests.

### 6. Monitoring and Logging
- Centralized logging with tools like ELK or CloudWatch.
- Set up anomaly detection and alerting.
- Enable audit logging for all authentication and critical actions.
